# Micronaut Jackson Issue

Micronaut doesn't honor Jackson's _@JsonGetter_ or _@JsonSetter_ when the property has the same name on entities (_@Entity_) and projections (_@Introspected_).

[,java]
----
@Introspected
public class ContactIntrospected
{
    @JsonIgnore
    private String phone;

    @JsonGetter("phone")
    public String formattedNumber() { //<.>
        return Formatter.formatPhone(phone);
    }

    @JsonIgnore
    public String getPhone() //<.>
    {
        return phone;
    }
----
. Never gets called
. Called even though it is ignored
